P1SOUNDS VINYL

During the project 1 sounds the team did work on using bulma in replacement of bootstrap, that help out with the display of the page. 
Putting toguether the images with the help of Lucas who custom made them, and added them to the display of the page. 
The images are currently displaying from a local storage without the need of an external one.
putting toguether the search bar the team did use variables, if tags, event listeners, and fetch with the help of noah and luis. 
So then every time the user would look for the artist name all their songs would come to display in the website. 
The website basically has an API link from apple itunes that is collecting the data of every artist which is an external storage. 
finally, there is a navbar that can help display some extra content on the in order to guide the custumer during their experience in the page. 

USER STORY.

As a user I want to search for song titles.

WHEN I search a title THEN I am prompted with related songs. 

WHEN I favorite a song THEN that song will be saved to local storage.

WHEN I click register THEN I am prompted with a user creation modal.
